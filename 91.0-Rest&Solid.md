## Rest (Representation State Transfer/TransferÃªncia representacional de estado)

### Rest is a development webservice pattern that follow 5 rules:
**1: Not Client Server:**
>	An REST API can't be an application Client and server. REST API is only a server side application.

**2: Stateless**
>	No records of clients or states are created when requests are made.

**3: Cacheable**
>	An api rest don't need to be cacheable, but need to be possible to be cacheable.

**4: Work with layers**
>	An api rest must work with layers, it means that our rest api must return the same results to our users, even if they uses proxy, firewall or any middleware

**5: Uniform and directly interface**
>	An api rest should be directly and uniform, it means that, our urls should be clear and directly, and endpoints(routes) services must be semantic with their methods.

### rest api development flow
>	Create routes with http verbs/methods

>	Run our server

>	Open our server (with cors)
>		yarn add cors > import cors from 'cors'; app.use(cors())

## S.O.L.I.D.
**S: Single-responsibility principle**
>	A class, component, entity or even function, must have only one responsibility


**O: Open-closed principle**
>	Classes, components or entities, needs to be closed to changes, but open to extends.
	>	Example: Our browser is closed to modifies, but open to be extended (recieveing extensions/plugins)

**L: Liskov substitution principle**
>	Sub-Classes that inherit from a class, needs to be successful to fulfill the parent class 'tasks'

**I: Interface segregation principle**
>	Clients (like a class that needs other methods) don't need to be forced to implement a function that they don't need it

**D: Dependency inversion principle**
>	A module, don't need to be impl
