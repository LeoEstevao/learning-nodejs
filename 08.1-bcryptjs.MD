# BCRYPTJS is a nodeJS package, that let us store our users password in Hashs

## Hash X Cryptography 
> When we hash a string, we can't reverse engineering it to see the real value. When we encrypt a string, if we have the encryption 'keys', we can decrypt and see the real value.

## Installing
    npm install bcryptjs
    OR
    yarn add bcryptjs
**Typescript projects**
    npm install @types/bcryptjs -D
    OR
    yarn add @types/bcryptjs -D

## Importing
```js
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
// OR
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';
```

>Salt (sal/tempero) It's an extra param, which will concat a string into the password to protect the system against attacks like rainbow table.
Ex: of bcrypt salt generated:
    **$2a$10$jrchKEGqxb.thcI8QDiWi**

## Sync
```js
// n = Number of rounds (default is 10 if omitted), and the minimum round is 4 (apparently)
let salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(n);
let hash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt);
```

>Authenticate
    >Compare the password (as hash) string, with the database stored hash, and return true or false
```js
let usrValidated = bcrypt.compareSync(usrPassword, findOneResult.PASSWORD);
```
